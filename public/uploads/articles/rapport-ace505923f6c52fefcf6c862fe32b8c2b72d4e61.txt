uses  TensorFlow for: 
-Machine learning
-deep learning

To make Google Duplex so realistic, Google used all of its collected conversation data and its Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)
technology to provide data points for the machine learning model

-A neural network is a computing system that is trained to do an automated task
recurrent neural network 

understand the context of the conversation

In order to make Duplex sound natural, Google used a concatenative and synthesis text to speech engine (Tacotron and WaveNet)
